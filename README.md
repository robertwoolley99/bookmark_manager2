# Database Issues

If you need to setup the datbase from scratch using postgresql do the following:

Connect to psql
    
Create the database using the psql command  `CREATE DATABASE bookmark__manager;`
    
Connect to the database using the pqsl command `\c bookmark_manager;`
    
Run the query we have saved in the file `01_create_bookmarks_table.sql`
